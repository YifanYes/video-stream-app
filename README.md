# Video Streaming App

This is a full-stack video streaming application combining the power of NestJS and React.
Streaming media is one of the most common use cases for data streaming.
Streaming enables a user to watch a video immediately without first downloading the video.
This way the user saves time and doesn't consume his storage space.

Streaming is advantageous for app performance. Data is sent in small segments or chunks, rather than all at once.
This is beneficial for app efficiency and cost management
